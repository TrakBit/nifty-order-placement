# Price alert system (WIP ðŸš§)

**Tracking instrument**:
<br/>
- NIFTY  
- BANKNIFTY

**API:** [Upstox API](https://upstox.com/uplink/trader-api/)

**Why is it written in Rust?**
<br/>The system aims to run all the market hours on the user's desktop. Hence, it aims to run at the lowest memory usage.
